Code Animo
"Bring Your Computer To Life"

[-About the Company-]
My name is Laurens Mathot and Code Animo is my company. I help people understand the tech they need to realize their vision and I write code for graphics and tools.

I love it when computers and the worlds created on them seem to come to life. When software is close to being awesome, but seems to be held back by a few problems, my hands start itching. So I learned programming, to be able to make changes.

My goal is to make life easier, more fun and most of all: cooler. So I spend most of my time thinking of ways to improve my work and the work of others. I spend the rest on actually implementing these plans. 


Code Animo is based in Amersfoort, The Netherlands


[-About the logo-]
If you see this file bundled with 'Surface Water' you might recognize the logo as a flow map created by the simulation. But the logo was actually created in a very old simulation I created in Flash/PixelBender when I was still in school. To me it symbolizes how simple rules can create amazingly complex systems.
