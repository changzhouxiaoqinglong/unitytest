  text: 'This component renders a depth map of the scene so the simulation can run
    on top of it.


    The most important setting is "Rendered Layers". The waves will appear to flow
    on top of all the meshes that are visible in this layer.


    The Camera Near Plane setting is applied to the depth camera it creates. Camera
    Height Offset compensates for the Near plane; it is there to make sure that objects
    near the bottom of the simulation are rendered.


    Behind the scenes information:

    It renders the simulation area from the bottom, but only renders the farthest
    away surfaces. This means that the resulting texture does not have to be mirrored
    by the simulation. It is also done in an attempt to show the highest LOD of a
    model at low altitude.'
