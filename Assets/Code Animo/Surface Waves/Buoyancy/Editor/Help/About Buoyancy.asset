  text: 'Buoyancy is currently only supported with DirectX 11.


    The Buoyancy manager applies forces on all the buoys (objects that have a buoy
    component) in the simulation area, if they''re under the waves. Wave and Terrain
    height are combined to determine whether buoy objects should be affected by the
    waves.


    It requires simulation information, which is only available on the GPU. The physics
    engine in Unity runs on the CPU, so Buoyancy Manager reads some simulation information
    back to system memory. This can only be done when the GPU isn''t busy, so it can
    cause quite lengthy wait times, which affect framerate.'
