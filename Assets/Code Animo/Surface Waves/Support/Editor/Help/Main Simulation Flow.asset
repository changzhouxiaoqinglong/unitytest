  text: 'The Simulation flow component on the ''Surface Waves'' GameObject runs the
    following steps:


    - First it calls the group of steps that only need to run once per frame. Things
    like the mouse input.


    - Second it calls the steps at the core of the simulation, which can be run multiple
    times per frame to increase the speed of the waves.


    - Lastly it calls the Rendering steps. These steps depend on the simulation being
    finished.'
