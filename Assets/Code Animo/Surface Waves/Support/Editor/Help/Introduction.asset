  text: 'Surface Waves creates dynamic rivers, lakes and oceans by making waves interact
    with the underlying terrain.


    The movement of the waves is calculated on the GPU.


    The simulation is built up out of a lot of separate steps. Each step uses its
    own component. The order in which these steps run is determined by the simulation
    flow components.


    On the left side of this window you can see the help files for these components.



    If you encounter a problem with Surface Waves, please report it using the issue
    tracker. You can find it from the top menu under Help > Code Animo > Surface Waves.'
