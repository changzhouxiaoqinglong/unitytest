  text: 'There are several different things that influence the apparent speed of waves
    in Surface Waves. Resolution, Framerate, how many times the simulation is run
    per frame, and the timescale of the flow step.


    The wave in the simulation are represented by cells which only communicate with
    their neighbours. That means that it takes longer  for the wave to travel a certain
    distance, if there are more cells that need to pass on the information. So increasing
    resolution reduces the speed of the waves in world-units.


    In Surface Waves version a2 the simulation does not run a fixed number of steps
    per frame, like physics. So the waves appear to move slower at lower framerates.
    In future versions, the simulation might be run independently of framerate.


    One possible way to speed up the simulation is to run the core of the simulation,
    the repeatable steps, multiple times per frame. The Repeatable Steps component
    allows you to set the number of times that each step should be run.


    Changing the deltatime variable on the WaveFlowCompute component also has an affect
    on the speed at which waves seem to move, although it''s not very suitable for
    it. The value reduces how much height of the waves is moved between cells each
    frame. Higher values make the waves appear less viscous, but they also make the
    simulation less stable (values over .5 will start looking like noise, because
    at that point the highest wave value will be on a different cell each frame).'
