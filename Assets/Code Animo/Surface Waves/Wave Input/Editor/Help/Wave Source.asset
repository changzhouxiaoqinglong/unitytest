  text: 'The Wave Source component inputs or outputs waves. It''s an input if its
    intensity is positive, and it''s an output if its intensity is negative.


    The input/output data is written into a texture that is used by the Wave Height
    Step to add and remove wave height.


    Components of this type are meant to be chained together, each building on top
    of the data created by previous wave sources. If Wave Sources are referenced in
    a Wave Source list, their ''previous input'' setting is automatically set when
    te simulation is running.'
