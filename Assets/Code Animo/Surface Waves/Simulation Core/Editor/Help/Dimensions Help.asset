  text: "The 'Dimensions' component determines the size of the simulation, and how
    detailed the waves are.\n\nHigher resolutions can be more realistic, but they
    are also more expensive. Both in terms of memory and GPU time.\n\nAt higher resolutions,
    waves will also appear to move slower, because all the cells that make up the
    simulation only interact with their neighbours. So having more cells means the
    simulation loop has to run more often before all cells have passed on the wave
    to their neighbours.\n\n\nObjects like buoys and WaveSources need to know which
    simulation they're in. That's why the Dimensions component automatically resizes
    the boxCollider (trigger) on the same GameObject.\n\nNOTE: The WaveSurface mesh
    group isn't automatically resized yet, so you have to manually delete and re-create
    the Wave Mesh Group after a resize. \n\nTo do this, go to the Game Object called
    'Wave Surface' under the 'Surface Waves' Game Object, and click 'Delete Group
    Members'. The button should then change to 'Create Group'. When you click that
    button, a new group will be created with the new dimensions."
