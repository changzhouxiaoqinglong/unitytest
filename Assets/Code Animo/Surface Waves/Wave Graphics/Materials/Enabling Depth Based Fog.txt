The materials that use the Complex Water shader have depth based fog. This uses the depth texture created by the currently rendering camera.

So for this to work, you either need to use Deferred Lighting, or enable Depth or DepthNormals DepthTextureMode on the camera (See Unity Script Reference for Camera.depthTextureMode).



Advanced Alternative: Use Shader.SetGlobalTexture("_CameraDepthTexture", the default depth texture), to set a custom depth manually.
