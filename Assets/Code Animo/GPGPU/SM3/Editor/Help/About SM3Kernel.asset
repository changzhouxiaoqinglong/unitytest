  text: "'Kernel' Components manage bits of code that runs on the GPU. The actual
    kernels themselves are found in shader files.\n\nSM3 stands for Shader Model 3.
    This component manages kernels that use standard Vertex + Fragment Shaders. \n\nWhen
    higher Shader Models are supported, you might just as well use compute shaders.
    These kernels are often used as a fall-back.\n\n\nYou can specify which pass should
    be used by setting its index, or -1 if you want to run all passes.\n\nOutput Texture
    name needs to be set to the name that's used by the code that uses this Kernel
    Component. "
